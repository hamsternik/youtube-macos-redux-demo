# youtube-macos-redux-demo

demo macOS app to showcase Redux design pattern written in Swift and SwiftUI

the idea is to build a simple youtube clone, so the user would be able (i) to search videos, (ii) watch a video from the search list and (iii) interact with selected video.

## youtube api 

start from the [youtube data api overview](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started). more details about public youtueb api (resource types), supported http methods for each resource, etc find at the [youtube api reference](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/). 

to simplify the youtube client development under apple platforms, check out the [Google APIs Client Library for Objective-C for REST](https://github.com/google/google-api-objectivec-client-for-rest).
